# # Binary Secret Handshake
 
# > There are 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand binary, and those who don't.
 
# You and your fellow flatirons are of those in the "know" when it comes to binary decide to come up with a secret "handshake".
 
# ```
# 1 = wink
# 10 = double blink
# 100 = close your eyes
# 1000 = jump
 
 
# 10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake.
# ```
 
# Write a program that will convert a binary number, represented as a string (i.e. "101010"), and convert it to the appropriate sequence of events for a secret handshake.
 
 
# ```
# handshake = SecretHandshake.new "1001"
# handshake.commands # => ["wink","jump"]
 
# handshake = SecretHandshake.new "11001"
# handshake.commands # => ["jump","wink"]
# ```
 
# The program should consider strings specifying an invalid binary as the value 0.
